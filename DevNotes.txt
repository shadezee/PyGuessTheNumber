1.0 original

2.0.0 Code rewrite
    **EXPECTED CHANGES**
    reduce length
    better formatting

    **IMPLEMENTED CHANGES**
    CHANGES
    changes length to 37 from 47
    removes pyperclip functionality
    changes variable name for the number of attempts and player name
    dissolves objective function
    rewrites the entire decision loop
        merges the previous loop for 'out of attempts' with the 'main loop.'
2.0.1 Allow replay functionality
    **EXPECTED CHANGES**
    the program allows the user to replay the game
        this automatically stops the command prompt from abruptly closing after the completion
    
    **IMPLEMENTED CHANGES**
    NEW
    adds the replay function

    CHANGES
    changes length to 55 from 47 
    brings back objective function
    wraps the entire decision loop into a function named guessGame

            inputSec is the secret number that will change every time the loop runs
        adds a 'break' keyword after every decision
        initializes replay function after the loop end
    the objective function now acts as the primary game running function as it will initiate the guessGame loop  
2.1 Initiating logging
    **EXPECTED CHANGES**
    the program should create a new folder in the directory of the running python application
    the folder should have a log file with various details of the running program.
    the program should make a copy of any pre-existing log before replacing it with a new one

    **IMPLEMENTED CHANGES**
    NEW
    changes length to 93 from 55 
    imports os, shutil and logging
    writes log in .log instead of .txt 
    stores various paths in new variables
    creates a log directory in the application's current working directory
    creates a backup of the previous log (if any)
    adds various logging instances
2.2 
    **EXPECTED CHANGES**
    none

    **IMPLEMENTED CHANGES**
    NEW
    changes length to 107 from 93
    logs the version of the program
    adds a function systemInfo to log system information

    the program can manage standard exceptions

    **IMPLEMENTED CHANGES**
    NEW
    changes length to 141 from 107

2.5 Code cleanup and rewrite
    **EXPECTED CHANGES**
    none

    **IMPLEMENTED CHANGES**
    NEW
    changes length to 164 from 141
    adds function cycleOne to skip game objective
    adds a warning for the user before shutting the application
    removes break from except clauses
        this fixes the error of not taking inputs again if user enters invalid option

    CHANGES
    changes variable names to make them more meaningful
    changes primary function to cycleOne from objective
    adds a pass instead of print for FileNotFoundError
2.7 Cryptography
